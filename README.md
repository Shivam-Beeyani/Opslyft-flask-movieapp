### An ugly flask app to store movie reviews and bucket lists

### Running this application:
1.Install and start mysql server and make a database called BucketList.

2.Add tables according to the given table schema.

3.Add stored procedures according to the procedures in the folder of the same name.

4.Edit app.py with your mysql credentials.

5.I suggest using a virtual environment
```
pip install flask
pip install flask-mysql
pip install requests
python app.py
```
